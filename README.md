This is just a location for me as I wanted a spot to keep all my plex / media related scripts that I am using.

These are the settings that I found most useful.

My home configuration:

- Verizon Gigabit FIOS
- Google Drive with an Encrypted Media Folder
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700 CPU @ 3.60GHz
- 32 GB of Memory
- 200 GB SSD Storage for my root
- 6TB mirrored ZFS for staging
